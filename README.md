## Design

### Design Choices
I wanted to choose colours for Kitty Den from Megatron as he was the inspiration for the website. From a picture of him as a kitten, I picked out his beautiful blue eyes and pink nose as a starting point for the website colours.

<details><summary>Inspiration Image - Megatron as a kitten</summary>
<img src="docs/design/megatron-inspiration-picture.JPG">
</details>

### Colours
Using these colours as a base: 
I chose an off-white for background to help reduce too much glare.

I chose dark blue to allow for good contrast as the primary colour.
Blue is also great for a care company as it gives the feeling of trustworthiness.

I chose a bright dark pink to pop against the white background and the dark blue while giving a playful feel to the site.

Feeling I needed another colour, a bright orange that works as a complementary colour to the blue while working well with the pink was chosen. I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to help find the right orange for the pink. Orange is also great for getting the playful nature of the site across.


#### Branding Colours

- Blue: primary colour: #2E266D
- Pink: secondary colour: #DE1D8D
- Orange: tertiary colour: #FF735C

<details><summary>Branding Colour Ideas</summary>

The colours used on the site

- Blue: primary colour: #2E266D
- Pink: secondary colour: #DE1D8D
- Orange: tertiary colour: #FF735C
- Off White: white colour: #FAFAFA;
- Overlay Off White: rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.7) - They off white colour at 70% opacity
- White: #FFFFFF - Used for contrast against the pink and off-white background
- Opaque Pink: rgba(222, 29, 141, 0.5) - Used for style elements to give a pop of colour
- Light Orange: #ffd6d0 a shade of the orange tertiary colour to brighten areas.

I tested multiple options of blue and pink before choosing them and building the full-colour scheme around them to ensure I was happy with the colours and felt I had the best colours to match the site's requirements while remaining accessible. 

I used the abode colour wheel and ColorSpace to decide on the final colours and test the contrast of the colours with the Abode's accessibility tools and tested on the live site with the WebAIM Wave tool.

### Fonts
Google Fonts is used to import the 'Indie Flower and Urbanist' font used throughout the website:
- [Indie Flower](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower) 
- [Urbanist](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Urbanist)
<br> 
Indie Flower is predominantly used for headers and areas selected for styling, such as people's names. It helps them stand out and appear different from the other text on the site to make an instant impact as the user lands on the page.
<br>
Urbanist is used for the body of the text to make it easy to read and provides a modern look while offering a visual contrast against Indie Flower.
<br>
I picked these fonts as Indie Flower offers a playful and personal feel to the site, while Urbanist provides a clean, easy-to-read font with a sleek appearance. Together they work in harmony to portray the playful and professional feel of the company.

### Structure
The page's structure is in well-known, user-friendly and visually attractive way. On arriving, the user sees a recognisable navigation bar which on smaller displays is a hamburger menu to the right and the company's logo on the left. The website consists of six separate pages:
 
- Homepage - with the following sections unique selling points, intro to Kitty Den and customer testimonials.

## Bugs

1. A horizontal scroll bar appears on desktop and mobile devices.

On testing the site on different devices and through Google developer tools, I noticed a horizontal scroll bar was on occurring. None of my added content appeared to be overflowing, but with Google Developer tools, I spotted that the .row class from Bootstrap was causing this issue.

I fixed this by adding an m-0 or g-0 class to the div element containing the row class providing an easy fix for the issue as it removed the horizontal margins the row was adding.

2. The animation for the hamburger menu that appears on hover was happening when the Nav Menu was expanded.

On testing the site on my mobile, I noticed the on-hover effect was happening when the Nav Menu was expanded. I looked at ways to prevent this, but overall I felt this animation added nothing to the website, so I removed it.

</details>

3. On testing the site on a Google Pixel 7, I noticed when pressing back to return to a previous page the Hamburger menu, which had transformed, was not re-setting like on other devices. 

I decided the best fix was to remove the checkbox, which I was using to create the transformation - as I felt this was likely causing the problem. I then changed the css to respond to an aria-expanded = true and false. On re-testing, this has fixed the issue and has not created any bugs on the other devices.

4. When I tested the carousel, I noticed the transition worked well for only two break points but struggled when I added a third.

As I did not want to compromise on the number of cards displayed for each breakpoint, I decided to remove the transitions after trying to fix and adjust them. 

5. When I tested the site on Firefox, the logo was not displaying.

I discovered this was due to width: fit-content. I had a few different options to correct this, but I chose width: auto was the best option, as the width of the logo is based on the declared height of the logo.
